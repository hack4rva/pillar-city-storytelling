# Richmond Arts B2 Persona: Low-Burden Visibility via Smart Aggregation

## Executive Summary
Richmond’s small arts venues and local artists operate with lean teams and limited technical capacity, yet they consistently maintain digital event listings to drive ticket sales. An analysis of representative Richmond organizations reveals that event publishing is already semi-structured: venues like Firehouse Theatre and Gallery5 expose per-event Google Calendar and ICS links [1] [2], while Eventbrite serves as the operational backbone for ticketed programming [3]. 

To successfully aggregate this persona's data without adding administrative burden, a platform must ingest existing per-event ICS links and Eventbrite API data rather than demanding manual entry or custom RSS feeds. Venues will accept aggregation that drives direct clicks to their canonical ticketing pages with clear attribution, but they will strongly resist content rewriting, re-hosting, or any process that creates stale data during last-minute changes (such as weather-related reschedules).

## Why This Persona Matters Now — Richmond venues publish events but lack effortless reach
Local arts organizations in Richmond already invest significant effort into maintaining their own event pages and ticketing platforms. However, their discovery reach is often limited to existing followers and newsletter subscribers. Aggregation can amplify their visibility and drive new audiences to their events, but only if it respects their existing technology stack. Any tool that requires these lean, often volunteer-supported teams to learn a new workflow or manually duplicate data entry will fail to achieve adoption.

## Persona B2: The Local Artist or Small Venue — Evidence-backed profile
A typical Richmond community venue or small theater operates with minimal staff, relying heavily on volunteers and third-party platforms to manage logistics. They promote their programming via a combination of Eventbrite, their own website calendars, and social media, prioritizing visibility gains that require zero extra data entry.

### Evidence Archetypes: Gallery5, Firehouse Theatre, Byrd Theatre — What they actually do
Three representative Richmond organizations illustrate the spectrum of technical setups and promotional strategies in the local arts scene: Eventbrite-first ticketing, per-event ICS links, and newsletter-first showtimes.

| Venue | Website Calendar Present | Per-Event ICS/Google Link | Sitewide RSS/iCal Visible | Ticketing Platform | Social Linked on Events | Email/Newsletter Emphasis | Notable Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gallery5** | Yes | Yes (per-event) [2] | Not observed | Eventbrite [3] | Instagram per-event [2] | Moderate | 18+ filters, price tiers ($10-$25) [2] |
| **Firehouse Theatre** | Yes | Yes (per-event) [1] | Not observed | Onsite ticket pages [1] | Social present | Moderate | Program type tags (Fringe/Mainstage) [1] |
| **Byrd Theatre** | Yes (showtimes page) [4] | Not observed per event | Not observed | Onsite ticketing/showtimes [5] | Social present | Strong [5] | Organ plays notes, newsletter-oriented [5] [4] |

*Key Takeaway: Venues utilize structured data at the individual event level (ICS) rather than the site level, and rely heavily on established ticketing platforms or direct email communication.*

### Inferred Solo Artist Persona
**[Inference]** A solo artist in Richmond likely lacks the infrastructure of a dedicated venue. They rely heavily on Instagram for awareness and Eventbrite (or a host venue’s website) for actual event listings and ticketing. They have virtually no web administration capacity to maintain RSS feeds or schema markup. Consequently, they are highly sensitive to attribution and brand control, needing any aggregator to accurately link back to their social profiles or direct ticketing pages without misrepresenting their work.

## Current Promotion Practices — Platforms, effort, and returns
The dominant promotional pattern for this persona is a combination of a website calendar, Eventbrite for transaction processing, Instagram/Facebook for awareness, and occasional newsletters. ROI is strictly measured in ticket clicks and physical attendance.

| Channel | Evidence from Venues | Typical Effort | What They Get Back |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Eventbrite** | Gallery5 organizer page shows 17 upcoming events; deep-linked from site [2] [3] | Low (duplicate from ticketing needs) | Ticket sales, analytics, transaction management |
| **Website Calendar** | Firehouse and Gallery5 use per-event ICS/Google Calendar links [1] [2] | Medium (content formatting) | Canonical info, SEO **[Inference]** |
| **Social (IG/FB)** | Gallery5 links to performer Instagrams per event; active Facebook page [2] [6] | Medium-high | Awareness beyond existing list **[Inference]** |
| **Email/Newsletter** | Byrd Theatre emphasizes email signup for schedules [5] | Medium | Repeat attendance, predictable audience **[Inference]** |

*Key Takeaway: Venues spend their limited time where transactions happen (Eventbrite) and where their core audience lives (website/email). Social media is used for discovery but is not the primary source of truth for event data.*

## Pain Points Solved by Aggregation — Without adding burden
Small venues face significant friction in their daily operations. An effective aggregation tool can solve these issues by ingesting existing pages and syncing changes automatically.

* **Multi-entry duplication:** Venues currently duplicate efforts across Eventbrite, their website, and social media.
* **Fragmented discovery:** Reaching new audiences is difficult when discovery is limited to existing followers and newsletter lists.
* **Stale updates and change management:** Last-minute changes require manual updates across all platforms. For example, Gallery5 had to visibly reschedule a volunteer event due to inclement weather [2]. If an aggregator fails to catch this, audiences show up at the wrong time.
* **Lack of unified analytics:** Venues struggle to track exactly where their ticket buyers are coming from across the web.

## Acceptance vs. Resistance — Terms this persona will demand
Because venues depend on ticket revenue and reputation, they will accept aggregation that drives clicks to their canonical pages with clear attribution. They will actively resist any tool that confuses ownership or adds administrative work.

| Stance | Requirements & Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Accept** | Auto-pulling from Eventbrite and venue pages; direct "Get Tickets" links to the canonical URL; visible venue name and logo. |
| **Resist** | Rewriting titles or descriptions; paywalled visibility; diverting sales to third-party carts; scraping social media as the primary source of truth. |
| **Require** | Opt-out capabilities per event; a simple corrections workflow; unedited content; analytics on referrals; an emergency update channel for weather/cancellations. |

*Key Takeaway: Control and consent are paramount. The aggregator must act as a pass-through to the venue's preferred ticketing destination, not a walled garden.*

## Tech Reality Check — Feeds, CMS, and integration paths
The technical capacity of Richmond's small arts venues is functional but fragmented. Integration must be multi-source to capture the full ecosystem.

* **Per-Event ICS is the Standard:** Both Firehouse Theatre and Gallery5 offer per-event Google Calendar and ICS export links [1] [2]. 
* **No Sitewide RSS:** Sitewide RSS or iCal feeds are rarely visible or maintained. Aggregators cannot depend on venue-managed feeds and must generate a synthetic normalized feed internally.
* **Eventbrite Dominance:** Eventbrite is prevalent for ticketing and event details (e.g., Gallery5 [3]).
* **Newsletter-First Venues:** Some venues, like The Byrd Theatre, steer audiences to a showtimes page and email signups rather than machine-readable calendars [5] [4]. This requires optional email-to-event parsing to prevent missed listings.

## Success and Failure Patterns — What good and bad aggregation looks like
For the B2 persona, the line between a helpful tool and a frustrating hindrance is thin.

* **Success:** The tool auto-updates when Eventbrite changes; it preserves critical audience fit details like Gallery5's 18+ age gates and $10-$25 price tiers [2]; it offers a one-click "claim" path for venues.
* **Failure:** The tool displays outdated rescheduled times (e.g., missing a weather shift [2]); it creates duplicate listings from multiple sources (scraping both the site and Eventbrite); or it edits copy in a way that breaks the brand's voice.

## Feature Requirements — Zero-burden tool spec for B2 persona
To work for this user without adding burden, the aggregation tool must deliver a no-workflow, high-accuracy pipeline with built-in control and clarity.

* **Source Ingestion:** Prioritize Eventbrite organizer-level API integration to capture canonical details with zero effort. Supplement with per-event ICS parsing (capturing timezone and UID) and venue page HTML extraction. Offer an email parser for newsletter-first venues like Byrd Theatre.
* **Data Model & Canonical Priority:** Prioritize the ticketing URL over the venue event page, and the venue page over social links. Retain and display age restrictions, price tiers, and format tags (e.g., Firehouse Fringe [1]).
* **Deduplication Engine:** Implement robust deduplication matching title, datetime, venue, and performers to prevent clutter from multi-channel listings.
* **Attribution & Controls:** Ensure the venue name and logo are prominent. Provide a direct "Get Tickets" link. Default to auto-include with a venue-level opt-out, a per-event opt-out, and a simple "claim venue" portal with a corrections form.
* **QA & Updates:** Build daily change detection (Eventbrite webhook or diff polling) with alerting to minimize stale times.
* **Analytics:** Provide a simple monthly email summary showing referral clicks to ticketing, new-to-venue users, and top discovery cohorts.
* **Embeds:** Offer an optional "Listed on X" badge to boost social proof, but require zero installation for the core service to work.

## KPIs That Prove Value to This Persona
To secure buy-in from lean venue teams, the aggregator must prove concrete impact using metrics they already care about.

* **Click-throughs:** Total referral clicks sent directly to their canonical ticketing pages.
* **Conversion Proxy:** **[Inference]** Eventbrite "view-to-buy" uplift originating from the aggregator.
* **Audience Expansion:** Share of new versus returning clickers.
* **Lead Time:** Percentage of clicks occurring 72+ hours pre-event versus last-minute, helping venues predict attendance.

## Rollout Plan for Richmond — Fast, respectful, low-friction
A phased rollout ensures high data quality and builds trust with the local arts community.

* **Phase 1:** Seed the platform with the top Eventbrite-heavy venues (e.g., Gallery5) and calendars with reliable per-event ICS links (e.g., Firehouse Theatre).
* **Phase 2:** Conduct outreach to venues to claim their profiles, providing analytics snapshots and demonstrating clear attribution.
* **Phase 3:** Partner with newsletter-first organizations (e.g., Byrd Theatre) to pilot an email-parsing feed and validate its accuracy.
* **Phase 4:** Publicize a "corrections hotline" and establish a 24-hour SLA for urgent changes to build reliability trust.

## Risks and Mitigations
Designing for transparency and graceful fallbacks is critical to mitigating the inherent risks of aggregation.

* **Accuracy Risk (Reschedules):** Venues frequently change times or dates [2]. *Mitigation:* Implement daily syncs, change alerts, and a strict canonical source hierarchy.
* **Consent and Brand Risk:** Venues fear unwanted re-hosting or misrepresentation. *Mitigation:* Use prominent attribution, unedited copy, per-event opt-outs, and an easy claim portal.
* **Platform Dependence:** Relying heavily on Eventbrite exposes the tool to API limits or changes. *Mitigation:* Use multi-source ingestion (ICS + HTML), local caching, and rate-aware polling.
* **Deduplication Clutter:** The same event appearing on Eventbrite, Facebook, and the venue site can cause multiple listings. *Mitigation:* Use robust entity resolution and flag conflicts for human review.
