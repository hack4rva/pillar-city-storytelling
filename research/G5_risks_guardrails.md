# Guardrails That Prevent Harm in Civic Arts & Story Tech

## Executive Summary
Civic technology prototypes operate in spaces of high public trust, meaning that even early-stage tools can cause disproportionate harm if deployed without proper guardrails. For arts event aggregators, the primary risk is stale data—publishing canceled or outdated events that lead residents to waste time and resources. For story collection tools, the risks center on privacy, consent, and the handling of sensitive or adversarial content. 

This report outlines the mandatory guardrails required to prevent these harms. Key findings indicate that stale-data harm is predictable and must be mitigated through transparent provenance (e.g., "last verified" timestamps) rather than assumed perfection. Furthermore, public story forms attract abuse rapidly, necessitating pre-publication moderation and explicit anonymity options. By implementing the checklists and protocols detailed below, civic tech teams can safely launch prototypes that protect users while gathering valuable community insights.

## Why Guardrails Matter Now
Early-stage civic tools can cause real harm if transparency, consent, and moderation are missing. Hackathon prototypes often lack the sophisticated engineering of commercial platforms, meaning they cannot automatically detect venue closures or silent event cancellations. In the context of story collection, tools designed to capture narratives about neighborhood change will inevitably receive sensitive disclosures regarding housing discrimination or domestic violence. Small UI choices—such as adding timestamps, requiring explicit consent prompts, and offering anonymity—are not optional features for later versions; they are ethical prerequisites that prevent outsized harm during initial pilots.

## Evidence of Common Failure Modes
Stale events, silent cancellations, spam, and adversarial content are not edge cases; they are the default failure states within days of launch.

| Failure Mode | Concrete Example | User Impact | Proposed Guardrail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stale Event Data** | A city parks department event is canceled due to weather, but the calendar is not updated [1]. | Residents travel to a closed venue or canceled event. | "Last verified" timestamps and source links. |
| **Orphaned Social Events** | Facebook events remain active or notify users incorrectly after the original event is deleted or changed [2]. | Attendees show up to nonexistent gatherings. | Auto-expire content past the event start time. |
| **Calendar Sync Errors** | Canceled events remain on users' Google Calendars even after notification [3]. | Schedule conflicts and confusion. | Clear "Flag as incorrect" buttons on the aggregator. |
| **Adversarial Submissions** | Public forms receive spam or off-topic content immediately upon launch. | Platform degradation and potential exposure to harmful content. | Pre-publication moderation queues. |

## Documented Standards to Emulate
Trained facilitation plus explicit, layered consent is the defensible minimum for any public storytelling. StoryCorps sets the ethical baseline for this process. The organization uses trained facilitators to guide conversations and requires participants to complete explicit release forms before their stories are used [4]. Furthermore, StoryCorps provides clear explanations of how stories will be stored, including archiving authorized stories at the Library of Congress, and makes them available online for future generations [4]. Civic tech prototypes should mirror this standard by implementing plain-language consent prefaces, explaining storage and audience, and providing clear opt-in mechanisms for public display.

## Anonymity-by-Design
Offering anonymous or pseudonymous submission on the form itself raises participation and reduces safety risks. Government examples demonstrate how to operationalize this:

| Agency / Organization | Anonymity Implementation | Source Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **U.S. House of Representatives** | Explicit dropdown option: "Yes, you can share my story anonymously." | Democratic Leader Share Your Story form [5]. |
| **Mass.gov** | Disclaimer stating stories may be used "barring identifying information." | Federal Action Story Collection Form [6]. |
| **City of San Jose** | Anonymous complaint hotline with specific "good cause" evaluations. | Board of Fair Campaign and Political Practices [7]. |
| **FCC** | Internal sharing only; submissions do not initiate formal complaints or public exposure. | Tell Us Your Story portal [8]. |

## Moderation and Anti-Gaming
Pre-publication review, rate-limiting, and provenance signals are proven levers to keep feeds useful and fair.

| Moderation Model | Strengths | Risks | Staffing Implications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Facilitated Collection** | High quality, safe environment (e.g., StoryCorps) [4]. | Low scale, high friction. | Requires trained staff for every submission. |
| **Pre-Moderation Queue** | Prevents all spam/harmful content from reaching the public. | Delays publication, creates bottlenecks. | Requires daily review by designated admins. |
| **Post-Moderation (Takedowns)** | Immediate gratification for users, high scale. | High risk of exposing users to harmful content. | Requires on-call triage and rapid response. |

## AI Theme Extraction Without Harm
When NLP tools surface "themes" from resident stories, they can amplify statistically common narratives while suppressing minority experiences, effectively reintroducing representational bias. Human review, sampling balance, and transparent reporting are required before labeling anything "community sentiment." Teams must require human review of AI outputs and publish methodology notes showing sample sizes and safeguards for low-frequency but high-impact stories.

## Sensitive Content Triage
If you can foresee sensitive submissions, you must have a triage playbook and referral partners ready. Because displacement and neighborhood change are explicitly cited problem contexts, submissions will likely include content on housing discrimination, domestic violence, and police encounters. Teams must define a triage matrix (immediate danger, mandated reporting, referrals) and train staff before launch.

## Transparency for Event Feeds
You cannot eliminate staleness, but you can make uncertainty auditable to users and easy to correct. Republishing stale details makes your platform the "source of record" in public perception. To mitigate this, platforms must default to deep-linking rather than republishing. Every event must display the source URL, retrieval method, and a "last verified" timestamp.

## Anti-Gaming for Arts Aggregation
Caps, deduplication, and provenance downranking prevent venue over-posting and misinformation creep.

| Tactic | Expected Effect | Edge Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Per-Venue Caps** | Prevents a single active venue from dominating the feed. | Festivals with dozens of legitimate micro-events. |
| **Fuzzy Deduplication** | Merges duplicate submissions of the same event. | Recurring events with slight title variations. |
| **Provenance Downranking** | Penalizes listings without a canonical source link. | Grassroots events that only exist on flyers. |

## Guardrails Checklist
The following tables outline the minimum guardrails that should be present in a prototype before any public demo or pilot.

### Arts Event Aggregation Guardrails

| Guardrail Feature | Stage Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Source URL Display** | Must have for demo | Direct link to the original event posting. |
| **"Last Verified" Timestamp** | Must have for demo | Visible indicator of when the data was last checked. |
| **"Flag Incorrect" Button** | Must have for pilot | One-click mechanism for users/venues to report errors. |
| **Auto-Expiry Rules** | Must have for pilot | Events automatically gray out or hide after start time. |
| **Per-Venue Posting Caps** | Can defer to v2 | Limits to prevent feed domination by single entities. |

### Story Collection Guardrails

| Guardrail Feature | Stage Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Explicit Consent Prompt** | Must have for demo | Plain-language agreement, not buried in TOS. |
| **Anonymity Option** | Must have for demo | Ability to submit without identifying information [5]. |
| **Pre-Publication Queue** | Must have for pilot | Staff review required before public display. |
| **Sensitive Content Triage Plan** | Must have for pilot | Documented protocol for handling disclosures of harm. |
| **AI Human-in-the-Loop Review** | Can defer to v2 | Mandatory human sign-off on AI-generated themes. |

## Metrics & Monitoring
Track time-to-correction, false-positive moderation rates, theme validation accuracy, and user trust signals to iterate safely. Suggested KPIs include a median time-to-correction of under 24 hours, ensuring 95% of events have a verified source, and maintaining a 100% human sign-off rate for AI theme approvals.

## Implementation Plan for a Hackathon-Grade Prototype
You can implement the must-haves with lightweight processes in 2–3 sprints:
* **Sprint 1:** Provenance fields, link-back rendering, "flag incorrect" UI, and basic admin queues.
* **Sprint 2:** Consent screen v1, anonymity toggles, PII segregation, and moderation workflows.
* **Sprint 3:** Triage matrix, partner referrals, and ensuring AI features are off by default pending human review.

## Evidence Pack and Risk Register

### Facts (with URLs)
* **Civic Event Aggregator Harm:** A documented instance of calendar confusion occurred when the Waukee Parks & Recreation Department canceled a "Park Play" event due to inclement weather, highlighting the need for accurate, updated civic event data (URL: http://waukee.org/Calendar.aspx?EID=5855) [1]. Additionally, Facebook events often cause confusion when old events have issues or are deleted but still notify users (URL: http://facebook.com/groups/226880980665982/posts/26205556779038380) [2].
* **StoryCorps Standard:** StoryCorps utilizes trained facilitators, records perspectives in the person's own words, requires release forms, and archives authorized stories at the Library of Congress (URL: http://minneapolismn.gov/government/programs-initiatives/racial-equity/your-mpls-story) [4].
* **City Story Collection Anonymity:** The U.S. House of Representatives "Share Your Story" form explicitly includes the option: "Yes, you can share my story anonymously" (URL: http://democraticleader.house.gov/shareyourstory) [5]. Similarly, Mass.gov collects stories "barring identifying information" (URL: http://mass.gov/forms/federal-action-story-collection-form) [6].

### Inferences
* **[Inference]** Without a "last verified" timestamp and a link-back-to-source policy, a Richmond arts aggregator will likely publish at least some incorrect event information within its first month of operation.
* **[Inference]** A public story submission form without explicit moderation will receive off-topic or harmful content within 24-48 hours of public launch.

### Unknowns
* Whether Richmond's Department of Arts, Culture and Heritage has internal policies on content moderation or story rights for any civic storytelling tools they may have piloted.
* Whether any Richmond arts organizations have experienced reputational harm from third-party aggregators.
