# Eventbrite API for Richmond Arts: Capabilities, Gaps, and a Multi-Source Strategy

## Executive Summary

Building a comprehensive arts event aggregator for Richmond, VA, requires a nuanced approach to data sourcing. An analysis of the Eventbrite public API reveals that while the platform is an indispensable repository for Richmond's independent and community arts scene, it cannot serve as a standalone primary data source. 

Eventbrite provides robust programmatic access via its RESTful API, requiring OAuth 2.0 authentication and utilizing a system of "expansions" to deliver detailed venue, category, and ticketing data. However, a critical coverage gap exists: Richmond's major flagship institutions—such as the Richmond Ballet, Virginia Repertory Theatre, and the University of Richmond's Modlin Center—utilize independent ticketing platforms like Etix, Spektrix, and proprietary systems. Furthermore, developer community reports indicate potential instability with Eventbrite's location-based search parameters, necessitating fallback search strategies. 

To build a reliable and comprehensive aggregator, Eventbrite should be implemented as a high-yield secondary pillar within a multi-source architecture, supplemented by direct integrations with major local institutions and community calendar feeds.

## API Access Summary: Endpoints, Authentication, and Rate Limits

Eventbrite's API is REST-based, returns responses in JSON, and requires OAuth 2.0 for authorization [1]. There is no anonymous public access; all requests must be authenticated, typically using a Bearer token [2] [3].

### Core Endpoints for Event Aggregation

The API relies heavily on an "expansion" feature, meaning base endpoints return lightweight objects, and developers must explicitly request additional nested data (like venues or categories) using the `expand` query parameter [2].

| Endpoint | Purpose | Key Parameters & Expansions | Strategic Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /v3/events/search/` | Find public events by query, category, and location | `location.address`, `location.within`, `expand=venue,organizer` | Paging returns a maximum of 50 rows per page [4]. Community notes flag location search fragility [3]. |
| `GET /v3/events/{event_id}/` | Retrieve detailed data for a single event | `expand=venue,category,subcategory,ticket_classes` | Essential for detail pages and fetching specific ticket prices [2]. |
| `GET /v3/categories/` | List top-level event categories | N/A | Use at startup to build dynamic category mapping [2]. |
| `GET /v3/subcategories/` | List granular event subcategories | N/A | Refines arts definitions (e.g., separating Music from Theatre) [2]. |

### Pagination and Rate Limits

While Eventbrite does not publicly publish strict free-tier rate limits in its primary documentation, developer tooling indicates that search results are paginated with a maximum of 50 rows per page [4]. 
* **Actionable Insight**: Implement robust exponential backoff and caching. Instead of executing on-demand bulk pulls when a user searches your app, schedule background jobs to fetch and cache the next 60–90 days of events in 50-item pages.

## Event Data Schema: Available Fields and Expansions

The Eventbrite API structures data into distinct objects. The base Event object provides core details, but critical aggregator fields—such as the venue address, category name, and ticket prices—must be appended using expansions [2].

### Required Fields and JSON Mapping

| Display Requirement | JSON Source / Expansion | Data Type | Reliability & Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Title** | `name` | String | Stable base field [4]. |
| **Description** | `description` | String (HTML) | Requires HTML sanitization before rendering in the UI. |
| **Start/End Time** | `start` / `end` | Datetime | Base field. |
| **Event URL** | `url` | String (URL) | Deep link to the Eventbrite checkout page. |
| **Venue Name & Address** | `expand=venue` | Object | Returns detailed venue information including the physical address [2]. |
| **Category** | `expand=category` | Object | Returns category ID, name, and localized names (e.g., "Music") [2] [5]. |
| **Organizer** | `expand=organizer` | Object | Information on the event sponsor; useful for deduplication [2]. |
| **Ticket Prices** | `expand=ticket_classes` | Array | Contains specific ticket tiers and costs [2]. |

* **Actionable Insight**: Default your search queries to include `expand=venue,category,subcategory`. Reserve the `ticket_classes` expansion for when a user clicks into an event detail page to minimize payload size and API overhead.

## Category Mapping to "Arts & Culture"

Eventbrite uses a standardized taxonomy of Categories and Subcategories. Hardcoding category IDs is risky; instead, fetch the taxonomy dynamically.

### Suggested Arts Taxonomy Mapping

| Eventbrite Category | Example Subcategories | Target Aggregator Taxonomy | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Music** (ID: 103) | Classical, Jazz, Rock, Folk | Music | Category 103 is explicitly defined as "Music" in API docs [2]. |
| **Performing & Visual Arts** | Theatre, Comedy, Dance, Improv | Performing Arts | Captures events like "Improv 301" at Coalition Theater and burlesque at Gallery5 [6]. |
| **Fine Art** | Painting, Drawing, Exhibitions | Visual Arts | Captures events like "Sketch 101" and VMFA meetups [7]. |

* **Actionable Insight**: At application startup, call `/v3/categories/` and `/v3/subcategories/` to store the `id` to `name` mapping [2]. Maintain an editable mapping file to route these to your internal "Arts & Culture" buckets.

## Search Design for Richmond: Filters, Fallbacks, and Pagination

Constructing the right search query is critical for capturing Richmond's specific geographic footprint while avoiding API errors.

### Recommended Search Profile and Risks
The standard approach to geographic search utilizes the `location.address` and `location.within` parameters (e.g., `location.address="Richmond, VA"`, `location.within="25mi"`) [4] [3]. 

However, a significant risk exists: developer community reports from August 2024 indicate that "search by location [is] deprecated now" [3]. If the API rejects or ignores location parameters, the endpoint will default to returning a global list of 50 events [3].

* **Actionable Insight (Fallback Strategy)**: If `location.address` fails in production, degrade gracefully. Query by arts categories and date ranges only, ensure `expand=venue` is active, and programmatically post-filter the JSON response by checking if `venue.city` equals "Richmond" or surrounding metro areas.

## Coverage Assessment: Eventbrite's Footprint in Richmond

Eventbrite provides excellent coverage of Richmond's independent venues, community arts organizations, comedy clubs, and mid-sized museums. 

### High-Volume Venues and Organizers on Eventbrite

| Venue / Organizer | Event Types Captured | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Gallery5** | Burlesque, live music, drawing clubs, benefits | Gallery5's official calendar links to over 20 Eventbrite ticketed events between February and May 2026 (e.g., "The Reveal Revue") [6] [8]. |
| **Coalition Theater** | Improv classes, sketch comedy | Listed heavily under Performing & Visual Arts and Fine Art (e.g., "Improv 301", "Sketch 101") [6] [7]. |
| **The Tin Pan** | Comedy, performances | Hosts events like "Samantha Bee – How to Survive Menopause" [6]. |
| **Museums & History** | Socials, talks, meetups | The Valentine ("The Garden Social"), American Civil War Museum, and VMFA-affiliated meetups actively use Eventbrite [7] [9]. |

## Identified Gaps: Major Institutions Bypassing Eventbrite

Relying solely on Eventbrite will result in a massive blind spot regarding Richmond's flagship performing arts seasons. Major institutions utilize dedicated, proprietary, or specialized ticketing platforms.

### Critical Coverage Gaps

| Institution | Ticketing Platform Used | Impact on Aggregator |
|---|---|---|
| **Richmond Ballet** | ETIX | Single tickets and season subscriptions for Dominion Energy Center and VMFA performances are sold exclusively via ETIX and the Ballet's box office [10]. |
| **Virginia Repertory Theatre** | Proprietary (tickets.va-rep.org) | Mainstage theatrical productions will not appear in Eventbrite API results [11]. |
| **Modlin Center for the Arts (Univ. of Richmond)** | Spektrix | The university transitioned its event registration and ticketing to Spektrix, going live on January 1, 2026 [12]. |

* **Actionable Insight**: Eventbrite cannot be the system of record. Users relying on your aggregator would miss the city's premier ballet, theatre, and university arts events if Eventbrite is the sole source.

## Data Quality, Deduplication, and Pricing Strategy

Because Eventbrite will be mixed with other data sources, strict deduplication is required.
* **Deduplication**: Match incoming events based on a composite key of normalized `title` + `start.local` + `venue.id`. 
* **Pricing Display**: Eventbrite UI listings often show "From $X.XX" (e.g., The Valentine's Garden Social from $32.58) [9]. Programmatically, this requires the `ticket_classes` expansion [2]. To save API calls, display "Price varies" or "Check ticket price" [6] on list views, and only fetch exact pricing when the user views the event details.

## Build Recommendation and Roadmap

**Recommendation**: Eventbrite should be implemented as **Pillar 2 of a 3-Pillar multi-source strategy**. It is essential for capturing the long tail of indie and community events but insufficient for a complete picture of Richmond arts.

### Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Focus Area | Integration Approach | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)** | Eventbrite Integration | Implement `/v3/events/search/` with OAuth 2.0 [1]. Map categories dynamically [2]. Build location-search fallbacks [3]. | High |
| **Phase 2 (Weeks 2-4)** | Major Institutions | Build direct scrapers or API connections for ETIX (Richmond Ballet) [10] and Virginia Rep's calendar [11]. | High |
| **Phase 3 (Weeks 4-6)** | University & Community | Integrate Spektrix public feeds for the Modlin Center [12]. Ingest standard ICS/RSS feeds for First Fridays and smaller galleries. | Medium |
