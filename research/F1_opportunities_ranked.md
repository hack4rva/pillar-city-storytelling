# Richmond Pillar 7 Hackathon: Data-Ready, Demo-Ready Wins in 48 Hours

## Executive Summary
Success in a 48-hour hackathon hinges on immediate data access and clear post-event ownership. For Richmond's "Pillar 7: A City That Tells Its Stories," mapping use-cases are "plug-and-play" because the City's GIS infrastructure is open, current, and API-ready. Conversely, event aggregation faces severe near-term data-access friction, as verified Richmond-wide event RSS/ICS/API endpoints are not readily available. 

To maximize Sunday demo impact and Monday continuation, teams should prioritize the **Arts & culture map** and the **Neighborhood history explorer**. These projects leverage existing ArcGIS FeatureServer layers (such as the Arts & Cultural District Incentive Zones and City Old & Historic Districts) and can be seeded with curated cultural heritage content from local institutions like the Richmond Public Library and The Valentine. Projects requiring deep internal system integration (Staff workflow helper) or unverified live feeds (Arts event aggregator) carry high failure risks and should be avoided unless specific mock data or APIs are secured prior to kickoff.

## Why This Matters Now: 48 Hours to Advance Pillar 7
Hackathons often produce brilliant concepts that die on Monday because they rely on unavailable data or lack an institutional home. To meaningfully advance Pillar 7, teams must choose data-ready, host-ready opportunities to ship a credible, ownable MVP by Sunday. By aligning technical builds with Richmond's existing open data portals and cultural platforms, teams can bypass data-scraping bottlenecks and focus on creating compelling, resident-facing storytelling experiences.

## Scoring Framework: Five Filters for Hackathon Viability
To objectively rank the seven proposed opportunity spaces, we evaluate each against a 1–5 scoring rubric designed specifically for the constraints of a 48-hour sprint.

| Criterion | 1 (Lowest Viability) | 3 (Moderate Viability) | 5 (Highest Viability) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data availability** | No source; requires internal access or scraping | Partial data; requires manual seeding or mock data | Public API/feeds confirmed and documented |
| **Technical complexity** | Enterprise integration; heavy machine learning | Standard CRUD app; basic API integration | Low-code/no-code viable; simple frontend |
| **Demo quality** | Back-office tool; invisible backend processes | Standard list/feed; functional but dry | Highly visual; interactive maps; audio/media |
| **Civic impact** | Niche administrative use | Addresses a moderate resident pain point | Directly solves a core Pillar 7 storytelling goal |
| **Continuation potential** | No clear owner; orphan project risk | Could be adopted with effort | Pre-identified institutional host (e.g., GeoHub) |

## Richmond Data Landscape: Plug-in vs. Partnership
Understanding what data is immediately accessible via APIs versus what requires manual curation is the most critical factor in selecting a hackathon project. Richmond's data landscape offers turnkey GIS layers but requires a curation-first approach for cultural content.

### Confirmed, API-Ready GIS Data
The City of Richmond provides robust, hackathon-ready spatial data through the Richmond GeoHub [1]. These layers are exposed as ArcGIS REST endpoints, making them trivial to integrate into web maps.
* **Arts & Cultural District Incentive Zones**: Represents the Art District Incentive Zone for the City of Richmond [2] [3]. It is publicly available with a Feature Layer API [2].
* **City Old & Historic Districts**: Contains 45 records representing districts designated by local ordinance [4]. It is publicly accessible, tagged for Planning and Development Review, and was last updated in 2020 [4] [5].
* **City Old & Historic Sites**: Represents city-recognized historic sites, including those on the National Register of Historic Places and the Virginia Landmarks Register [6].

### Cultural Content Platforms (Curation-First)
While Richmond boasts rich digital archives, hackathon teams should not expect to build automated, bulk-ingestion pipelines in 48 hours due to varying API standards and rights restrictions. Instead, teams should curate links and metadata from these public portals:
* **Richmond Public Library (RPL)**: Hosts Digital Special Collections via ContentDM, featuring a mix of library-owned materials and public submissions [7] [8].
* **The Valentine**: Offers "Richmond Stories," an actively growing online collection database [9].
* **Library of Virginia (LVA)**: Provides extensive digital collections, including photographs and historical records [10].
* **VCU Libraries**: Maintains digital collections and a Community Digitization Program aimed at preserving Richmond and Virginia history [11].

## Opportunity-by-Opportunity Viability Rankings
Based on the data landscape and the 48-hour constraint, here is the ranked viability of all seven opportunity spaces.

| Rank | Opportunity Space | Data (1-5) | Tech (1-5) | Demo (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Cont. (1-5) | Total Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Arts & culture map** | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 | **23** |
| **2** | **Neighborhood history explorer** | 4 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | **21** |
| **3** | **Story collection portal** | 3 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | **20** |
| **4** | **Story-to-insight dashboard** | 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 3 | **16** |
| **5** | **Neighborhood event discovery feed** | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | **14** |
| **6** | **Arts event aggregator** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | **12** |
| **7** | **Staff workflow helper** | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | **9** |

### 1. Arts & Culture Map (Geographic Visualization)
* **Enablers**: Powered by confirmed ArcGIS REST layers for the Arts District [2], Old & Historic Districts [4], and Historic Sites [6].
* **Risks**: Custom license terms on City data; teams must keep attribution intact [2] [4].
* **Demo**: A highly visual, City-branded map with district overlays and popups linking to RPL or Valentine items.

### 2. Neighborhood History Explorer (Place-Based, Seeded Content)
* **Enablers**: Combines GIS boundary layers with curated links to RPL, Valentine, LVA, and VCU items [10] [9] [7] [11].
* **Risks**: Image rights restrictions. Teams must use thumbnails and external links rather than mirroring media.
* **Demo**: Users click a historic district to view a gallery of 5–10 seeded stories and archival items.

### 3. Story Collection Portal (Voice/Text, Consent-First)
* **Enablers**: Teams build their own data capture. RPL's existing community-submitted collections model provides a natural post-event home [7] [8].
* **Risks**: Handling PII and consent. Requires explicit licensing toggles and a basic moderation queue.
* **Demo**: A live record-and-submit flow, an admin review queue, and playback of 3 live recordings.

### 4. Story-to-Insight Dashboard (Theme Extraction)
* **Enablers**: Can show value if seeded with 25–50 curated items and simple rules-based tagging.
* **Risks**: Sparse corpus. Without high volume, automated NLP theme extraction will be fragile and inaccurate.
* **Demo**: Theme filters over time/map, with CSV export capabilities.

### 5. Neighborhood Event Discovery Feed (Geographic Filter)
* **Enablers**: Viable only if a single, reliable feed is found on day one.
* **Risks**: Unverified APIs and scraping fragility. High risk of breaking during the demo.
* **Demo**: Map and list of 10–20 pilot events with geographic filters.

### 6. Arts Event Aggregator (API + RSS Pipeline)
* **Enablers**: A common hackathon pattern *if* feeds exist.
* **Risks**: Multiple unverified sources, rate limits, and unstable HTML scraping make this a high-integration cost with low probability of weekend success.
* **Demo**: Narrow scope to 1–2 feeds or risk having nothing to show.

### 7. Staff Workflow Helper (Civic Engagement Staff)
* **Enablers**: Only viable if a sponsoring department commits mock data on Friday night.
* **Risks**: No internal API access and strict security constraints. Low "Sunday wow" factor for judges.
* **Demo**: Prototype intake/triage on mock JSON.

## Top Two Recommendations
To maximize deliverability and impact, teams should bet the weekend on the **Arts & culture map** or the **Neighborhood history explorer**. 

Both opportunities are powered by confirmed, highly reliable ArcGIS REST data from the Richmond GeoHub [1] [4]. They both offer exceptional "Sunday demo pop" through interactive, place-based visuals that directly align with Pillar 7's storytelling mandate. Furthermore, both have immediate post-event homes: the map can be hosted via City IT/GIS on the GeoHub, while the history explorer can be embedded in the GeoHub and linked from library or museum sites. 

*(Secondary Recommendation: If a team skews heavily toward full-stack web development and UX rather than GIS, the **Story collection portal** is a highly viable alternative.)*

## Decision Tree: Matching Teams to Opportunities
Use team skills and data realities to route teams quickly on Friday night.

| Team Profile | Must-Have Skills | Best-Fit Opportunity | Why It Works | Avoid If... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spatial Builders** | GIS, JavaScript, UX | Arts & culture map | Turnkey ArcGIS REST endpoints allow immediate frontend work. | Team lacks mapping library experience (Leaflet/Mapbox). |
| **Storytellers** | Data viz, Content curation | Neighborhood history explorer | High impact from curating existing archives into a spatial narrative. | Team wants to build complex backend pipelines. |
| **Product Makers** | Full-stack web, UX, Ethics | Story collection portal | Focuses on user flow, consent architecture, and media capture. | Team cannot implement basic security/PII protections. |
| **Data Scientists** | NLP, Backend, Python | Story-to-insight dashboard | Allows for text analysis and theme extraction on a seeded corpus. | Team lacks a curated dataset to process. |
| **Integration Hackers** | Scrapers, API wrangling | Event discovery feed | High risk/reward data pipeline challenge. | No live feed is confirmed by Saturday 11 AM. |

## Build Playbooks: 48-Hour Execution Plans
Opinionated, time-boxed steps reduce risk and ensure a polished demo by Sunday afternoon.

### Playbook 1: Arts & Culture Map
* **Friday (Scope & Setup)**: Confirm ArcGIS layers (Arts District, Historic Districts) [2] [4]. Sketch the UX. Stand up the base web map and load the FeatureServer layers.
* **Saturday (Features & Integration)**: Build interactive popups. Add attribution and external links to cultural institutions. Implement basic filtering (e.g., by district type).
* **Sunday (Polish & Protect)**: Apply City branding. Conduct accessibility checks. **Crucial**: Prepare an offline demo backup in case of venue Wi-Fi failure.

### Playbook 2: Neighborhood History Explorer
* **Friday (Curation & Architecture)**: Define 3–4 target geographies. Manually curate 30 high-quality links from RPL, The Valentine, LVA, and VCU [10] [9] [7] [11]. Document rights notes.
* **Saturday (Build & Bind)**: Build the map and the associated media gallery. Define the metadata schema (Title, Year, Source, Link). Implement search and filter functions. Ensure strict attribution.
* **Sunday (Narrative & Hardening)**: Write a compelling story walkthrough script for the judges. Harden frontend performance.

## Demo Strategy: Winning Hearts and Minds
A successful 5-minute pitch should lead with a resident journey. Start by showing how a local citizen discovers the hidden history of their specific street or records their own memory. Avoid spending time explaining the backend architecture. Close the demo by explicitly stating the continuity plan—naming the specific Richmond agency or institution (e.g., GeoHub or RPL) that can adopt the project on Monday.

## Continuation & Ownership: The Monday Handoff
Projects die when they lack a host. Design with the destination in mind:
* **Arts & culture map**: Handoff to City IT/GIS for inclusion in the Richmond GeoHub [1] [12].
* **Neighborhood history explorer**: Embed within the GeoHub and establish cross-links from RPL and Valentine local history pages [9] [8].
* **Story collection portal**: Transition stewardship to the Richmond Public Library's local history program, which already manages community-submitted digital collections [7].

## Risks, Ethics, and Licensing
Treat digital rights and privacy as core product requirements, not afterthoughts.

| Risk Factor | Where It Appears | Required Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Licensing** | ArcGIS Hub datasets | Log license fields; datasets are public but flagged with "Custom License" [2] [4]. Maintain attribution. |
| **Copyright Infringement** | Museum/Library archives | Do not bulk-copy media. Store only metadata, use thumbnails, and link directly to the source institution [9] [7]. |
| **Privacy & PII** | Story collection portal | Implement explicit consent text, age gating, and a link-only policy for third-party content. |

## Metrics That Matter: Proving Post-Event Value
To prove the project's worth to City stakeholders post-hackathon, track engagement and contribution quality rather than vanity metrics. Focus on:
* Unique visitors segmented by historic district.
* Number of story submissions that include valid, explicit consent.
* Time-on-page for historical galleries.
* Adoption rate by partner institutions (e.g., links generated from library sites).
